# 🌍 Disaster Management System

## 🔥 Overview
The **Disaster Management System** is a comprehensive application designed to aid in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. It integrates advanced **machine learning models** for **image classification**, **real-time data analysis**, and **resource allocation**, providing a robust platform for crisis management.

---
## 🚀 Key Features

### 🖼️ Image Classification
- Uses **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** to classify disaster-related images (e.g., damaged buildings) with **94% accuracy**.

### 📊 Real-time Data Analysis
- Processes data from various sources (social media, sensors) to assess disaster impact and prioritize responses.

### 📍 Resource Allocation
- Optimizes deployment of resources based on predictive analytics and real-time needs.

### 🤖 Chatbot Integration
- Provides real-time updates, FAQs, and emergency assistance.

### 🐦 Twitter Scraping
- Gathers and analyzes tweets to enhance situational awareness and gauge public sentiment.
